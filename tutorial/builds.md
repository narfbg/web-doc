# The PHP Manual builds

The PHP Manual is written in [DocBook][docbook] and built by [PhD][phd], and
these builds are rsynced to the mirrors for users to use.

## Mirror builds
The [rsync box][rsync.php.net] builds the manuals every night, at around 23:00 CST.
The mirrors then pick up these builds when they sync, which usually happens every hour.
When a mirror syncs depends on how its cron is set up.

## Doc server builds
The [docs development server][docs.php.net] builds the manual four times a day
(0:15 6:15 12:15 and 18:15 UTC). This takes place on the [euk2][euk2] server.
An easy way to see when each translation was last built, is to look at the
[doc downloads page with dates][download-docs]. Also note that several old
translations reside on this particular server, as it attempts to build every
translation (both active and inactive).

## CHM builds
The CHM version of the manual is built on a Windows machine and pulled on Fridays,
for distribution to mirrors. [Richard][rquadling] maintains these builds.

## Validation
Aside from running `php configure.php â€“with-lang=foo` (see [editing](editing.php))
for a language, another way to check if the docs validated is by looking at build
dates on the doc server. See "Doc server builds", above.

## Additional notes
- If a manual does not validate on Friday, it will not be pushed to the mirrors
  until it does validate (hopefully, the upcoming Friday).
- Only active translations are selectable/downloadable, and this is managed in
  [phpweb/includes/languages.inc][languages.inc]

## The humans who manage these
If there is a problem with the synced builds, it's wise to contact
[Derick][derick] or [Hannes][bjori].
If a problem exists on the development server ([docs.php.net][docs.php.net]),
then contact the documentation team.
